A repository with code for exploratory data analysis of unemployment statistics in California

Found out that the status of the data collection is split into 3: Preliminary, prelim, and final
Found out that all data points up to June 2023 are 'final' statistics
To make it easier, we will assume that preliminary means these data points are not conclusive and therefore cannot be accurate for use in a statistical analysis
Filtered out the data entries that are preliminary at the same time as seasonal adjustment is made
To do next: check if June 2023 is the latest date in the dataset (helps with working on time-series data too)
